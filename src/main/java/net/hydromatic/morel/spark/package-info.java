/**
 * The Spark adapter: executes queries on a Spark cluster via Spark Connect.
 *
 * <p>This package needs JDK 17 and the gRPC, protobuf and Arrow libraries,
 * which the rest of Morel does not. It is compiled only when the "spark" Maven
 * profile is active, and the rest of Morel refers to it only through {@link
 * net.hydromatic.morel.foreign.SparkBackend}, which loads it by name.
