 * whole-tree rules, in the order given, until none fires. Then it rewrites the
 * tree bottom-up: a node's inputs first, and the trees nested in its
 * expressions, then the node, where it tries the node rules in the order given
 * and applies the first that fires. A firing may put new nodes under the
 * replacement, so the replacement is rewritten in turn, and the rules are tried
 * again at it until none fires. The order of the rules and of the walk being
 * fixed, the result depends on the tree, the rules and the context -- the
 * environment, and whether the rows are read -- and nothing else.
 *
 * <p>With assertions on, every firing is checked: the replacement has the type
 * of the node it replaces, and is a well-formed tree by {@link RelValidator}.
