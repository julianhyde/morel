(*) If the expression is 'elem set' we can deduce the extent.
from e suchThat (e elem scott.emp)
  where e.deptno = 20
  yield e.ename;
val it = ["SMITH","JONES","SCOTT","ADAMS","FORD"] : string list


(*) A function that finds its data internally.
let
  fun isEmp e =
    e elem scott.emp
in
  from e suchThat isEmp e
    where e.deptno = 20
    yield e.ename
end;
val it = ["SMITH","JONES","SCOTT","ADAMS","FORD"] : string list

let
  fun isEmp e =
    e elem scott.emp
in
  from e suchThat isEmp e andalso e.deptno = 20
    yield e.ename
end;
val it = ["SMITH","JONES","SCOTT","ADAMS","FORD"] : string list


(*) TODO: as previous, but 'fun' followed by 'from' without using 'let'

(*) Similar to 'isEmp' but with a conjunctive condition.
let
  fun isClerk e =
    e elem scott.emp andalso e.job = "CLERK"
in
  from e suchThat isClerk e andalso e.deptno = 20
    yield e.ename
end;
val it = ["SMITH","ADAMS"] : string list


(*) A disjunctive condition prevents the extent.
(*) TODO: throw an error, rather than returning an empty list
let
  fun isEmp50 e =
    e elem scott.emp orelse e.deptno = 50
in
  from e suchThat isEmp50 e
    yield e.ename
end;
val it = [] : string list


(*) A function with external extent.
fun hasJob (e, job) =
  e.job = job;
java.lang.ClassCastException: class net.hydromatic.morel.type.TypeVar cannot be cast to class net.hydromatic.morel.type.RecordLikeType (net.hydromatic.morel.type.TypeVar and net.hydromatic.morel.type.RecordLikeType are in unnamed module of loader 'app')

(*) Valid, because the argument has an extent.
let
  fun hasJob (e, job) =
    e.job = job
in
  from e in scott.emp,
    j suchThat hasJob (e, j)
    yield j
end;
val it = [] : string list

(*) Invalid, because the argument has no extent.
from e suchThat hasJob (e, "CLERK");
stdIn:2.17-2.23 Error: unbound variable or constructor: hasJob
  raised at: stdIn:2.17-2.23


(*) A string function with external extent.
(*) Given s2, we could generate finite s1.
fun isPrefix (s1, s2) =
  String.isPrefix s1 s2;
val isPrefix = fn : string * string -> bool

(*) This is invalid, but it could be valid, and would return
(*) ["", "a", "ab", "abc", "abcd"];
from s suchThat isPrefix (s, "abcd");
val it = [] : string list


(*) An integer function with external extent.
(*) Given j, k we could generate finite i.
fun isBetween (i, j, k) =
  i <= j andalso j <= k;
val isBetween = fn : 'a * 'a * 'a -> bool


(*) End suchThat.sml
