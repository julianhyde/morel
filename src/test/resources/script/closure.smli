(*) Simple factorial function
let
  fun fact n =
    if n = 0 then 1 else n * fact (n - 1)
in
  fact 5
end;
> val it = 120 : int

(*) Similar, but using parallel functions
let
  fun fact 0 = 1
    | fact n = n * fact (n - 1)
in
  fact 5
end;
> val it = 120 : int

(*) Similar, but using 'case'
let
  fun fact n =
    case n
      of 0 => 1
       | n => n * fact (n - 1)
in
  fact 5
end;
> val it = 120 : int

(*) Similar, but 'val rec'
let
  val rec fact =
    fn n =>
      case n
        of 0 => 1
         | n => n * fact (n - 1)
in
  fact 5
end;
> val it = 120 : int

(*) Closure; int variable 'n' is captured in the function definition
val one = 1;
> val one = 1 : int
fun fact 0 = one
  | fact n = n * fact (n - 1);
> val fact = fn : int -> int
fact 5;
> val it = 120 : int
val one = 2;
> val one = 2 : int
fact 5;
> val it = 120 : int
fun fact 0 = one
  | fact n = n * fact (n - 1);
> val fact = fn : int -> int
fact 5;
> val it = 240 : int

(*) Closure; function 'f' is captured in the function definition
val f = fn x => x - 1;
> val f = fn : int -> int
fun fact3 0 = 1
  | fact3 n = n * fact3 (f n);
> val fact3 = fn : int -> int
fact3 5;
> val it = 120 : int

(*) Closure; function 'f' is an argument to an enclosing function.
fun baz4 f =
  let
    fun fact4 0 = 1
      | fact4 n = n * fact4 (f n)
  in
    fact4 5
end;
> val baz4 = fn : (int -> int) -> int
baz4 (fn i => i - 1);
> val it = 120 : int

(*) Closure; function 'f' is not the only argument.
fun baz5 (f, m) =
  let
    fun fact5 0 = 1
      | fact5 n = n * fact5 (f n)
  in
    fact5 m
end;
> val baz5 = fn : (int -> int) * int -> int
baz5 (fn i => i - 1, 5);
> val it = 120 : int

(*) As previous, with shadowed 'n'.
fun baz6 (f, n) =
  let
    fun fact6 0 = 1
      | fact6 n = n * fact6 (f n)
  in
    fact6 n
end;
> val baz6 = fn : (int -> int) * int -> int
baz6 (fn i => i - 1, 5);
> val it = 120 : int

(*) Permutations. Captured variable 'k', is at the top level to prevent inlining.
val k = 3;
> val k = 3 : int
val rec perm = fn n => if n = k then k else n * perm (n - 1);
> val perm = fn : int -> int
perm 5;
> val it = 60 : int

(*) As previous, but captured variable is local and is probably inlined.
let
  val k = 3
  val rec perm = fn n => if n = k then k else n * perm (n - 1)
in
  perm 5
end;
> val it = 60 : int

(*) As previous, replacing captured variable with constant.
(*) The implementation may still use a closure, so that the recursive function
(*) can reference itself by name.
let
  val rec perm3 = fn n => if n = 3 then n else n * perm3 (n - 1)
in
  perm3 5
end;
> val it = 60 : int

(*) End closure.smli
